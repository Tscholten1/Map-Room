        <p>This project is the culmination of lessons and techniques learned throughout the coursework for my graduate certificate in ineractive web-mapping at the University of Kentucky, <i>Design For Interactive Web Mapping</i>. The map includes a wide variety of user interaction elements that include check boxes to turn on/off specific point location layers, marker clustering which aggregates large numbers of locations into one marker at a given scale, ability to drop a marker to designate a travel starting point, and the ability to click on a second point location to determine the distance (in miles) and time (by walking, biking, driving) to travel to the destination point.</p>

        <h3>Map features include:</h3>
        <p>
            <li>Several interactive elements that give the user the ability to select various data attributes and have the map dynamically update. User interaction is one of the most important differences between traditional static maps and web-based maps and the ability to change the map not only offers new possibilities for understanding the information, but It also makes engaging with a map more interesting and rewarding: it's fun!</li>
            <Li>Clicking on point locations of pharmacies, hospitals, and grocery stores calls up a pop-up box that provides the name and address of the specific location.</Li>
            <Li>Because of the large number of point locations that cluster in the City of Chicago, a Leaflet plugin was used
                <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster">Leaflet marker cluster</a>. This plugin clusters the markers and shows the number of items in each cluster, and as the user zooms in, the map adjusts the clusters based on the current view. This not only makes the map easier for the user to understand, it’s also a more efficient form of displaying dense concentrations of data points.
            </Li>
            <Li>An information panel, available when interacting with features, which will display more information than space allows within the popups or tooltips.</Li>
        </p>

        <h3>Key concepts:</h3>
        <Li>Used the drawMap() function which uses GeoJSON data to create a L.GeoJson object with basic styles, adds it to the map, and then fits the map view to the extent of the layer.</Li>
        <Li>Used the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp">AJAX</a> tool to load an external file containing GeoJSON data. These data contained both the geometry information for drawing SVG elements on the map and the attribute data.</Li>
        <Li>Loaded GeoJSON data using the JQuery method .getJSON(). The callback function executes and accesses the GeoJSON data which has been parsed by JQuery and preserved in the same JSON structure</Li>
        <Li>Created and used the Leaflet L.GeoJson object method</Li>
        <Li>Invoked Leaflet methods on layer groups and individual layers</Li>
        <Li>Used a Leaflet layer control to manage multiple data layers</Li>
        <Li>Loaded GeoJSON data stored as a JavaScript object and saved within an external file into the script</Li>
        <Li>Used the Leaflet L.geoJson() method to draw point-level data to a Leaflet GeoJson layer</Li>

        <h3>Software, tools, methods, and data used:</h3>
        <Li>GitHub (repository hosting service)</Li>
        <Li>Used <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">Mapshaper</a>.This site enables editing map data in shapefile, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, DBF, and CSV formats.</Li>
        <Li>Used <a href="https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm">Convert CSV files to Geojson</a>.This site converts Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Excel files into Geojson (and other formats) by loading or a CSV or Excel file, or loading from an external web page. This tool runs on the client-side using Javascript, so data never leaves a local computer. Saved the output by copying or use the "Download Result" feature.</Li>
        <Li>Used <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster">Leaflet marker cluster</a>.This not only makes the map easier for the user to understand, it’s also more efficient.</Li>
        <Li>Brackets (text editor)</Li>

        <p>This project synthesized a variety of tools, techniques, and methods throughout MAP 671, <i>Introduction to New Mapping.
            </i> Key lessons learned include:</p>

        <li>Creating a process to export Google location data from my Google account into a usable format for mapping. This involved:</li>
        <li>Exporting data from Google location history located on cell phone. Because Google allows only exporting in monthly time frames, I had to export each day for the time frame that I wanted as a .KML file.</li>
        <li>Upon exporting each day's data, I then uploaded that data to Geojson.io where I was able to see and verify all point locations.</li>
        <li>Next, I was able to export all 15 days of individual .KML files as one geojson file which was then uploaded to Mapbox</li>
        <li>Two duplicate files were made of this dataset to show a line segment of my travel route and a second to show point locations</li>
        <li>These two datasets were then styled with color and size to create a visually appealing map features.</li>
        <li>Working with numerous CSS and HTML refinements to create a visually and interactively pleasing map. Specific elements that I explored and used include:</li>
        <li>Resizing large (both in pixels and megabytes) photos</li>
        <li>Placment of photos within a two column web page</li>
        <li>Inserting a Mapbox map within the web page</li>
        <li>Creating hyperlinks that provide readers with a convenient way to gain additional information on the location or site that was visited.</li>
        <li>Styled datasets in Mapbox for point locations, line segments, and feature labels.</li>
        <li>A seperate geojson file was created of a smaller set of locations to highligh key areas that would help to provide reference on the map.</li>


        <h3>Web page and map features include:</h3>
        <p>
            <Li>Details for selected points of interest that were visted on the trip including an image/photo of the location.</Li>
            <Li>Paragraphs providing a synopsis of the points of interest</Li>
            <Li>Hyperlinks (in blue text) that directs the user to an external web source of additional information on the point of interest</Li>

        <h3>Devils Tower National Monument</h3>
        <p>This project involved creating a web page to feature and describe Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming. In addition to a two-column layout that provided text and graphics describing the geologic and historical nature of the landmark, the web page includes a dynamic map created using Mapbox Studio. This project involved initially acquiring data from the United States Board of Geographic Names (GNIS), working with Mapbox Studio to create a baselayer, add custom layers (points), specifying the map position, and styling the label visualization with data conditions.</p>

            <Li>An information panel, available when interacting with county features, which will display more information than space allows within the popups or tooltips.</Li>

        <h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Wisconsin (2015)</h3>
        <p>This proportional symbol map shows the relative magnitude of green house gas emissions (GHG) in 2015 by large facilites in Wisconsin. Data are shown by <span style='color: #bd4932; font-weight: bold;'>fuel combustion</span> and <span style='color: #105b63; font-weight: bold;'> process emissions</span>. The use of proportional symbols was the better choice to illustrate the amount of Co2 since this is based on an exact point location. Proportional maps are also best suited when showing magnitudes, or amounts of some numerical phenomena relative to other locations.
